@article{authSurvey2021, title={Attacks and defenses in user authentication systems: A survey}, volume={188}, ISSN={10848045}, DOI={10.1016/j.jnca.2021.103080}, abstractNote={User authentication systems (in short authentication systems) have wide utilization in our daily life. Unfortu­ nately, existing authentication systems are prone to various attacks while both system security and usability are expected to be satisfied. But the current research still lacks a thorough survey on various types of attacks and corresponding countermeasures regarding user authentication, including traditional password-based and emerging biometric-based systems. In this paper, we make a comprehensive review on attacks and defenses of the authentication systems. We firstly introduce a number of common attacks by classifying them into different categories based on attacker knowledge, attack target, attack form and attack strength. Then, we propose a set of evaluation criteria for evaluating different kinds of attack defense mechanisms. Furthermore, we review and evaluate the existing methods of detecting and resisting attacks in the authentication systems by employing the proposed evaluation criteria as a common measure. Specifically, we focus on comparing and analyzing the performance of different defense mechanisms in different types of authentication systems. Through serious re­ view and analysis, we put forward a number of open issues and propose some promising future research di­ rections, hoping to inspire further research in this field.}, journal={Journal of Network and Computer Applications}, author={Wang, Xuerui and Yan, Zheng and Zhang, Rui and Zhang, Peng}, year={2021}, month={Aug}, pages={103080} }
@article{authTrendSurvey2019, title={Recent Trends in User Authentication – A Survey}, volume={7}, ISSN={2169-3536}, DOI={10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932400}, abstractNote={Recent advancements in technology have led to profusion of personal computing devices, such as smart phone, tablet, watch, glasses, and many more. This has contributed to the realization of a digital world where important daily tasks can be performed over the Internet from any place and at any time and using any device. At the same time, advances in pervasive computing technologies have brought to fruition the concept of smart spaces that target the automated provision of customized services to the inhabitants effortlessly. User authentication, i.e., a procedure to verify the identity of the user, is essential in the digital world so as to protect the user’s personal data stored online (e.g., online bank accounts) and on personal devices (e.g., smart phones) and to also enable customized services in smart spaces (e.g., adjusting room temperature and so on). Recently, traditional authentication mechanisms (e.g., passwords or ﬁngerprints) have been repeatedly shown to be vulnerable to subversion. Researchers thus have proposed numerous new mechanisms to authenticate the users in the aforementioned scenarios. This paper presents an overview of these novel systems, so as to guide the future research efforts in these domains.}, journal={IEEE Access}, author={Shah, Syed W. and Kanhere, Salil S.}, year={2019}, pages={112505–112519} }

Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k-anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, μ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.}, number={05}, journal={International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems}, author={Sweeney, Latanya}, year={2002}, month={Oct}, pages={557–570} }

Since these are personal data being transmitted and are outside the control of the user, this approach causes privacy issues. Continuous authentication has security challenges concerning poor matching rates and susceptibility of replay attacks. The security issues are mainly poor matching rates and the problems of replay attacks. In this survey, we present an overview of continuous authentication and comprehensively discusses its different modes, and issues that these modes have related to security, privacy, and usability. A comparison of privacy-preserving approaches dealing with the privacy issues is provided, and lastly recommendations for secure, privacy-preserving, and user-friendly continuous authentication.}, number={17}, journal={Sensors}, author={Baig, Ahmed Fraz and Eskeland, Sigurd}, year={2021}, month={Sep}, pages={5967} }

In this way, privacy metrics contribute to improving user privacy in the digital world. The diversity and complexity of privacy metrics in the literature make an informed choice of metrics challenging. As a result, instead of using existing metrics, new metrics are proposed frequently, and privacy studies are often incomparable. In this survey, we alleviate these problems by structuring the landscape of privacy metrics. To this end, we explain and discuss a selection of over 80 privacy metrics and introduce categorizations based on the aspect of privacy they measure, their required inputs, and the type of data that needs protection. In addition, we present a method on how to choose privacy metrics based on nine questions that help identify the right privacy metrics for a given scenario, and highlight topics where additional work on privacy metrics is needed. Our survey spans multiple privacy domains and can be understood as a general framework for privacy measurement.}, number={3}, journal={ACM Computing Surveys}, author={Wagner, Isabel and Eckhoff, David}, year={2018}, month={Jul}, pages={1–38} }

Over the years, passwords have become long and complex thanks to security policy and awareness. However, the security of user passwords remains unclear. Therefore, understanding users passwords is vital to improve the strength of passwords and system security in general. In this paper, we investigate one speciﬁc pattern, i.e., the preﬁx and postﬁx of user passwords. To facilitate password preﬁx and postﬁx (P3) analysis, we propose both hierarchical segmentation / optimization algorithms and password preﬁx/postﬁx graphs (P3G) construction and P3G visualizations. Through case study over real-world user passwords, we demonstrate P3 analysis and visualization are effective in identifying unique patterns for different user categories. The results suggest strong correlations between preﬁx/postﬁx and their context in user passwords.}, number={5}, journal={International Journal of Information Security}, author={Yu, Xiaoying and Liao, Qi}, year={2019}, month={Oct}, pages={647–663} }
