The compiled pdf is [here](./paper.pdf). 

## What is this?

Research paper for CPSC 454 - Cloud Computing and Cloud Security. 

Abstract: 

> User authentication is a critical part of cloud computing.
> It is often the first step taken before conducting sensitive digital activities, such as unlocking one's personal device or accessing one's online service accounts.
> For this reason, authentication has been the go-to target for both researchers and malicious actors -- the former seeking ways to secure the digital world, the latter seeking ways to do digital harm.
> Of interest to the security professionals is the former -- the vast body of research and review of authentication mechanisms, both current and new.
> This paper aims to provide a survey of those studies by providing a brief overview of current authentication mechanisms as well as an analysis on how much user privacy they trade away for the sake of security.
> To achieve the latter, this paper introduces Revocability, a metric on how easy it is to invalidate breached secrets.
> Revocability is then used to assess the privacy impact of various authentication schemes and their potential harm in case of an inevitable data breach.

## Prerequisites 

You kinda need Org-mode for this. 

Load up the `paper.org` file in Emacs and export it as pdf. 

## Why did you put this on Github? 

dude my Syncthing volume is full lol gotta back this up somehow
